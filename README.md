# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where classes are not being applied correctly, even with seemingly correct implementation.

## Problem
The issue occurs where specific Tailwind CSS classes fail to render their expected styles.  This can be due to a number of reasons, including:

* **Incorrect Configuration:** Problems within your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`).
* **Missing Plugins:** If using a plugin-based Tailwind utility, it may need to be explicitly enabled.
* **CSS Conflicts:** Other CSS styles might be overriding Tailwind's classes.
* **Build Process Issues:** Problems in your build process might prevent Tailwind's styles from being correctly incorporated.

## Solution
The solution involves systematically checking these potential problem areas. Please refer to `bugSolution.js` for a practical example demonstrating how to resolve this issue.
