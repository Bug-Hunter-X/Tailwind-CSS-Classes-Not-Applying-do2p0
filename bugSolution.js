```javascript
//Ensure that your Tailwind config is correctly set up and pointing to your CSS files.
//tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}" ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};

//Check for any CSS conflicts by inspecting the browser's developer tools.
//Make sure that other CSS rules are not overriding your Tailwind classes.

//Verify that all necessary plugins are correctly configured and enabled within your `tailwind.config.js` file.

//Clear your browser cache and/or restart your development server.

//If you're still having issues, verify that your build process is correctly compiling and including your Tailwind styles in the final output.

//Example with corrected implementation and additional debugging steps
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
  <p>This div should now have a red background and padding.</p>
</div>
